# Orange Box Demos
## K8s
* `00` Bootstrap Juju in HA (to fill the 3 VMs on OB), deploy Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes bundle and launch juju status inside watch.
* `01` CDoK bundle will populate all but 1 of the OB nodes - demonstrate scaling out another worker onto the remaining node.
* `02` Copy k8s config from master and run proxy to provide access to the k8s dashboard.
* `03` Start microbox demo workload and print address to browse to (you will need access to the OB network; usually via sshuttle).
* `99` Burn everything to the ground.
